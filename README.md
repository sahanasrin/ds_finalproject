Project Title: Predicting Median Income in the United States

Authors: Sahana Srinivasan, Jake Kochmansky, Jae Gnazzo, Nathaniel Spilka

Motivating Question: Using a small number of continuous variables, how accurately can our specified model predict median 
household income in United States Census Tracts?

Status: Complete. Github page can be found [here](https://sahanasrin.github.io/ds_finalproject/. Github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/sahanasrin/ds_finalproject).

Data: The primary source of data is the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey 5-year (ACS5) from 2013 thru 2017. An API Census Key is needed for access. Additionally, the Childhood Opportunity Index Dataset provided additional variables. More information on the 2017 ACS5 can be found [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/table-and-geography-changes/2017/5-year.html).
